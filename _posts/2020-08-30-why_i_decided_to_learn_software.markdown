Ever since I was a kid, I was always the handyman for my family when it came to technology. Whether it was plugging in a video game console to the TV or adding a contact in their contact list they always came to me for help. Doing that for a while got me interested in technology and the stem field but I was young still and knew nothing about the different careers in the stem field. How websites and apps are made have also always interested me. I was a sophomore in high school when the first door opened for me to get a deeper view of the stem field. I took a class called "Intro to Technology". The first half was about and what's inside the computer and their functionality. In the second part of the class, we started getting into the software side and my eyes were wide open. We started moving blocks around to build methods and blocks in Scratch. A week past and I make my first account on CodeAcademy.com. We started with python and I knew instantly i wanted to write code and learn more programming languages. It was only an intro class so we only learned the basics of python. Taking that class deepened my understanding of code and the stem field.

The past two weeks have been super challenging and frustrating but spending hours on a lab and finally seeing the green make me feel so much joy and I love it. As i continue my studies I expect more challenges along the way.
